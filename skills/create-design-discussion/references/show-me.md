description: Visual guidance for concise diagrams, code-shape sketches, and focused HTML artifacts.

Use the smallest visual that explains the current decision. Keep prose short and put the visual beside the text it supports.

- Use pseudocode for logic.
- Use call trees for runtime flow.
- Use component trees for UI structure.
- Use file trees for ownership.
- Use Mermaid for sequence, data flow, or control flow.
- Use diff blocks when the point is what changes.
- Use a focused HTML artifact when annotations, layout, or side-by-side comparison are clearer than markdown.

Example file tree:

```text
packages/
├── billing/        # invoice and subscription flows
├── ledger/         # persisted account movements
└── notifier/       # outbound receipt delivery
```

Example link to an HTML artifact saved in the task directory:

[show-me-{description}.html](show-me-{description}.html)
