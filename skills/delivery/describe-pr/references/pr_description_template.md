Ticket: [{TICKET_ID}]({TICKET_URL}) | Task: `{TASK_SLUG}` | Walkthrough: [{PR_WALKTHROUGH_URL}]({PR_WALKTHROUGH_URL})

## Purpose

{One sentence explaining the problem addressed and the capability this PR adds.}

## Acceptance criteria

Omit this section when `task.md` states none.

- {One criterion from the task, then the check that decides it: command, request, or observation. A criterion this pull request does not satisfy says what is missing.}

## Special things to note

- {Name up to three items a reviewer should not miss, such as migrations, constraints, tradeoffs, or unusual choices. Write "None." if nothing needs special attention.}

## Evidence

Omit this section when the task has no `evidence` artifact.

- {Result line from the evidence receipt: tests passed, failed, untested; revision tested.}
- {One bullet per recorded surface: label, link to its `report.md`, where the video is posted.}

## Change outline

{Use the smallest set of structural views needed to explain the implementation. Omit unused view types.}

{Short lead-in for a data shape, API contract, or schema change.}

```diff
{Focused diff or complete target shape.}
```

{Short lead-in for changed code responsibilities.}

```text
{Shallow file tree or ownership sketch.}
```

{Short lead-in for runtime behavior.}

```diff
{Pseudocode, control flow, call tree, data flow, or component tree.}
```

{End with the one detail a reviewer needs before reading the diff.}

## Human Review

### Review targets

- {Pull request behavior, risk, and changed files the human should inspect.}

### Verify

- [ ] {Exact review or hosted-check confirmation required before the next review round.}

### Known limits

- {Known limit, or `None.`}
